Before reading further, ask yourself:

Have you ever wondered about how tax brackets affect your total income? Ok I know that sounds boring. Let me ask in a way that is *even more* boring:

Do you ever wonder whether allowing your income to increase into a higher tax bracket would cause all of your earnings to be taxed at a higher rate?

[Other people certainly think this.](https://www.fool.com/taxes/2019/01/11/the-most-misunderstood-thing-about-income-taxes.aspx) 

"Some mistakenly believe that if you earn a single additional dollar that takes you up to the 22% bracket, it'll cost you an extra 10 percentage points in taxes on every penny of your income."

This understanding is incorrect, as marginal tax rates only apply to additional dollars added, and not dollars already gained. Put another way, only the money above the tax bracket threshold is taxed at the higher rate.



Why is this incorrect understanding so prevalent? For some reason, system 1 (the fast, intuitive system of thinking) is tempted by the easily available logic

This easily available, yet incorrect logic reminds me of the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)

A bat and a ball cost a combined $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?




An experiment might be designed to test how people respond to marginal tax rate and election prediction models with a scale that gauges how confident people are in their responses. There might also be a timer during participant responses that can give a measure of the connection between response time and accuracy, similar to the other CRT experiments.
