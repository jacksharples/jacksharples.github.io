Before reading further, ask yourself:

Have you ever wondered about tax brackets? Ok I know that sounds boring. Let me ask in a way that is *even more* boring:

Do you wonder whether allowing your income to increase into a higher tax bracket would cause all of your earnings to be taxed at a higher rate?

[Other people certainly think this.](https://www.fool.com/taxes/2019/01/11/the-most-misunderstood-thing-about-income-taxes.aspx)

Unfortunately this understanding is incorrect. 

This easily available, yet incorrect logic reminds me of the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)

A bat and a ball cost a combined $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?



*Marginal Tax rate!*
-In reality, only the money above the bracket value is taxed at the higher rate.





~LITERATURE~

The Cognitive reflection test - Tax rate and election models are examples of situations where there is a quick response that is popular and incorrect. Discuss the other CRT examples.


~EXTENSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS~

An experiment might be designed to test how people respond to marginal tax rate and election prediction models with a scale that gauges how confident people are in their responses. There might also be a timer during participant responses that can give a measure of the connection between response time and accuracy, similar to the other CRT experiments.
