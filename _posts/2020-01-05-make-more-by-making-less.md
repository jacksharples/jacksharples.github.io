Before reading further, ask yourself:

Have you ever wondered about how tax brackets affect your total income? Ok I know that sounds boring. Let me ask in a way that is *even more* boring:

Do you ever wonder whether allowing your income to increase into a higher tax bracket would cause all of your earnings to be taxed at a higher rate?

I recently overheard a conversation between two nurses that were discussing how they didn't want to work overtime because the high overtime bonus would put them into a higher tax bracket and they would end up making less than if they had just stuck to their normal hours.

Sound absurd?   It is absurd, however [these ladies are not alone in thier mistaken judgement](https://www.fool.com/taxes/2019/01/11/the-most-misunderstood-thing-about-income-taxes.aspx):

"Some mistakenly believe that if you earn a single additional dollar that takes you up to the 22% bracket, it'll cost you an extra 10 percentage points in taxes on every penny of your income."

This understanding is incorrect, as marginal tax rates only apply to additional dollars added, and not dollars already gained. Put another way, only the money above the tax bracket threshold is taxed at the higher rate.



Why is this incorrect understanding so prevalent? They're arguing that they will ultimately be making less money when they earn more.

For some reason, system 1 (the fast, intuitive system of thinking) is tempted by the easily available logic.

This easily available, yet incorrect logic reminds me of the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)

A bat and a ball cost a combined $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 

If you're like me, your first reaction is that the ball *obviously* costs a dime and this question is easy because I am generally a pretty smart guy and I am usually pretty good at math problems like this.

The self-congratulation faded away immediately for me when I checked the answer key and discovered (still incredulously) that the ball costs 5 cents and the bat costs $1.05.





Perhaps there is inherent distrust of the people making the tax laws. 



An experiment might be designed to test how people respond to marginal tax rate and election prediction models with a scale that gauges how confident people are in their responses. There might also be a timer during participant responses that can give a measure of the connection between response time and accuracy, similar to the other CRT experiments.
