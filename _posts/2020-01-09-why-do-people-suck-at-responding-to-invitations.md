title:  "Why Do People Suck At Responding to Invitations?"

A friend of mine, we’ll call him Buddy,  recently wed in Texas, a COVID hotspot. I told my family about the wedding and how I’d like to go, but I didn’t feel it was right, considering I’m subjecting them to the virus. Their response was, “fuck no, you’re not going.” And that was that. I felt bad, but I had a built in excuse to decline an event which I did not want to attend. A month prior to the wedding, I had an extremely uncomfortable conversation with Buddy that I would have to decline. A few days before the wedding date, I decided to call and check in with him. Buddy told me that a week before the wedding 40% of invitees cancelled. He was angry and perplexed saying, "everyone knew COVID wasn't going away. I don’t understand why people waited until the last minute to cancel." Although I gave one month’s notice, I couldn’t say much as he was fuming and I did not want to have another uncomfortable conversation considering that I too cancelled. I tried to awkwardly console him which was a futile effort. So this brings me to the question: why do people suck at responding to invitations?


##Whhhy?

The logical reason is that these, especially weddings, are uncomfortable topics. We all want to go to these events during normal situations, but don’t want to under current conditions. Weddings and large events are huge celebrations and life events. It is considered a faux pas to decline if you are a part of the wedding party unless you have a legitimate reason. If someone is still having a wedding during a pandemic, they likely are downplaying the virus or have succumbed to a sunk-cost fallacy in which they feel they have already put in too much energy, money, etc. to back out now. Taking all of this into account, there is considerable pressure to attend, and sometimes the organizers don’t understand this when people are opposed. Many times we hope that things will change in the future, so we want to wait until we’re absolutely certain. We also utilize avoidance behavior to ignore the topic altogether. Speaking with mutual friends, others felt this way and hoped that it would be canceled so as to avoid the impending doom of a conversation. 

Let’s view this from a Behavioral Science perspective, as after all this is a Behavioral Science blog. Looking at this from a social norms standpoint, people tend to look toward their reference network to see what is acceptable behavior. Expectations of how others act is the biggest driver of behavior in a norm. From my experience, since this was uncharted territory of how to act in a pandemic, I checked in frequently with my friends prior to the wedding to see if they were canceling. In a way, we were checking to see if it was socially acceptable to cancel during a pandemic and didn’t want to be the first one to do so. 

Time inconsistency and hyperbolic discounting can help to explain why we procrastinate these decisions. Many of us believe the cost of delaying the act of cancelling an invitation to be low when we are months away from the event. Through prospect theory, we would rather gamble with having a slight probability of the wedding being called off or the virus to magically disappear, rather than the alternative of the certain discomfort when cancelling right away.



##So what can people do about it?

Organizer:
Besides the obvious answer of not having a wedding or equivalent gathering in a pandemic, we can apply this to non-pandemic situations as well. By moving the deadline for an RSVP back a few weeks, you’re giving yourself a buffer. In addition, normalizing behavior by saying that it’s understandable if those invited can’t attend will help to spread out declined invitations so it’s not all at the last minute. Nudging people by sending out reminders consistently will facilitate decision-making. It will also help to highlight the numerous people who have already responded. If a large number of people have not responded, don’t bring this up in a reminder, as it can normalize that behavior.


Attendee:
If you’re part of the invited party, first bask in the glow of having a social life. If you know you’re not going, cancel immediately and don’t delay. This will bring you relief and make you look much better compared to any last minute cancellations. If you’re on the fence, mark a due date prior to the invitation’s requested date and make a decision by then. If you’re on the fence during a pandemic, DON’T DO IT. Decline the invitation, pat yourself on the back, and buy that pair of shoes you’ve been eyeing all quarantine with the money you saved even though you know damn well you’ll only be wearing slippers for the next year.
